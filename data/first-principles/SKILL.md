# First Principles Thinking Skill - Fundamental Problem-Solving Methodology

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive expertise in **first principles thinking** - a powerful problem-solving methodology that breaks down complex problems into their most fundamental truths and builds solutions from the ground up. Rather than reasoning by analogy (copying what others do), first principles thinking enables you to reason from foundational facts to create truly innovative solutions.

## Requirements

**No external dependencies required**

This skill is purely methodology-based and can be applied to any domain:

- Software engineering and system design
- Business strategy and decision-making
- Product development and innovation
- Scientific problem-solving
- Technical architecture

## Operational Modes

### Guide Mode (Advisory)

- Explains first principles methodology and frameworks
- Recommends questioning strategies
- Teaches systematic deconstruction techniques
- Provides conceptual guidance without execution
- See [GUIDE.md](spec/GUIDE.md) for details

### Facilitator Mode (Interactive)

- Guides you through structured questioning frameworks
- Helps decompose problems step-by-step
- Challenges assumptions interactively
- Tracks reasoning chain and fundamental truths
- Validates logical reconstruction
- See [FACILITATOR.md](spec/FACILITATOR.md) for details

### Integration Mode (Domain-Specific)

- Applies first principles thinking to specific domains
- Enhances domain-specific skills with foundational reasoning
- Provides frameworks for systematic analysis
- See [INTEGRATION.md](spec/INTEGRATION.md) for details

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Methodology & Frameworks

- Custom questioning patterns for different problem types

### 3. Problem Deconstruction

Systematic breakdown capabilities ([DECONSTRUCTION.md](spec/DECONSTRUCTION.md)):

- Identifying fundamental components
- Separating facts from assumptions
- Mapping dependencies and relationships
- Recognizing hidden assumptions
- Testing what can be known with certainty

### 4. Reconstruction Strategies

Building solutions from fundamentals ([RECONSTRUCTION.md](spec/RECONSTRUCTION.md)):

- Starting from validated truths
- Logical building blocks
- Constraint validation
- Novel combination techniques
- Solution space exploration

### 5. Real-World Applications

Practical application patterns ([EXAMPLES.md](spec/EXAMPLES.md)):

- Technical problem-solving case studies
- Business strategy applications
- Product development examples
- System design scenarios
- Innovation breakthroughs

### 6. Domain Integration

Integration with specialized knowledge ([INTEGRATION.md](spec/INTEGRATION.md)):

- Enhancing technical skills with FPT
- Decision-making frameworks
- Architecture and design applications
- How other skills can leverage this methodology
- Cross-domain pattern recognition

## Quick Start

### Understanding the Methodology

**User**: "Explain first principles thinking"

**Guide Mode Response**:
> First principles thinking is reasoning from foundational truths rather than by analogy. Instead of doing something because "that's how it's done," you break the problem down to what you know is absolutely true, then build solutions from there.
>
> **Example**: Elon Musk's approach to rocket costs
>
> - Conventional: "Rockets cost $65M, that's just how it is"
> - First principles: "What are rockets made of? What do raw materials cost? Why the gap?"
> - Result: Identified that materials cost ~2% of rocket price, revolutionized with reusable rockets
>
> See [METHODOLOGY.md](spec/METHODOLOGY.md) for the complete framework.

### Solving a Problem

**User**: "Help me apply first principles to reduce our deployment time"

**Facilitator Mode Response**:
> I'll guide you through first principles analysis:
>
> **Step 1: Define the Problem**
> Current deployment takes 45 minutes. What exactly are we trying to achieve?
>
> - Get code from repository to production
> - Ensure quality and safety
> - Minimize downtime
>
> **Step 2: Break Down Current Process**
> Let's list every step in your deployment:
>
> - What happens first?
> - What are the dependencies?
> - What can we know for certain about each step?
>
> [Continues with structured questioning...]

### Integrating with Other Skills

**User**: "How can I use this with domain-specific skills?"

**Integration Mode Response**:
> First principles thinking enhances any domain skill by providing systematic reasoning:
>
> **With Technical Skills**:
>
> - Architecture decisions: Start from actual requirements, not patterns
> - Performance: Identify true bottlenecks, not assumptions
> - Security: Threat model from fundamental attack surfaces
>
> **With Business Skills**:
>
> - Strategy: Validate market assumptions from customer needs
> - Product: Build from user problems, not feature lists
> - Operations: Optimize from actual constraints
>
> See [INTEGRATION.md](spec/INTEGRATION.md) for detailed patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

### Optimal Use Cases

1. **Novel Problems** - No existing solution patterns
2. **Innovation Required** - Breaking through conventional thinking
3. **Critical Decisions** - High stakes requiring sound reasoning
4. **System Design** - Building architecture from requirements
5. **Challenging Assumptions** - Industry "best practices" feel wrong
6. **Existing Solutions Inadequate** - Current approaches aren't working
7. **Deep Understanding Needed** - Need to truly understand, not just apply

### When NOT to Use

- **Time-Critical Emergencies** - Use proven solutions first
- **Well-Solved Problems** - Don't reinvent the wheel unnecessarily
- **Low-Stakes Decisions** - Overhead may not be worth it
- **Learning Existing Solutions** - Study conventional approaches first
